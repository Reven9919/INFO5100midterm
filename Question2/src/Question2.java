//There are many differences between abstract class and interface
//From speed, interface is slow and abstract is fast
//from Inheritance, a class can implements multiple interfaces and the class can inherit only one abstract class
//from access modifiers, the interface don't have access modifiers and abstract have one access modifier
//from class type, interface have only public abstract class and abstract class has protected and public abstract methods
//from multiple inheritances, interface implement several interfaces and abstract class only have one abstract class
//from default implementation interface need to find many times as it appears
//from when to use interface used to future enhancement, abstract class used to avoid independence
//from implementation interface is abstract so it cannot provide any code, abstract class define the identity of a class
//from abstract keyword in an abstract interface it's optional to declare a method as an abstract and in abstract class the
//abstract keyword is compulsory to declare a method as an abstract
//from constructor interface cannot declare constructors and abstract class can declare constructors
